Repository of the game **Bella Ciao**, rpg interactive fiction for the Game-Off 2020 Game jam.

*You’r in your apartment in Mars, it’s currently the year 3020, and you had been through a lot lately, in an absolute need of a change of scenery. Lucky for you, you happen to be workin as a freelance journalist, and it seems your friend, Carlo Lumini, from MARS MEDIA has been trying to reach out for you, must be for another job folloging the trail for a story.*

**BELLA CIAO** *Solar Saudade*, it’s a visual novel with a simple but deep RPG system, inspired in the agnostic pen and paper role playing games, with a sci-fi and noir touch. You as the player, must seek the truth behind the mysterious launching of a ship from Charon, a moon of Pluto, with destination unknown, although there’s some suspicions.

It was made with twine using the SugarCube 2 sotry format, coded in TwineScript and Javascript, using the adventage of web technologies to deliver a fun, small game. Here we share the source code in Twee format, and the assets of the first part of the game. Hope you enjoy it playing and reviewing the code as much as we had fun making it.
